                        In 1973, while working as an assistant for T.K. Ryan's Tumbleweeds, Jim Davis created the comic strip Gnorm Gnat, which ran only in the Pendleton Times of Pendleton, Indiana from 1972 to 1975 and met with little success. One editor famously said "[Davis'] art was good, his gags were great, [but] nobody can identify with bugs."

                        Davis decided to take a long, hard look at current comic strips to determine what species of animal star characters might be more popular. He felt that dogs were doing well, but noticed no prominent cats. Davis figured he could create a cat star, having grown up on a farm with twenty-five cats. Thus was created the character of Garfield.

                        Garfield, the star, was based on the cats Davis grew up around; he took his name and personality from Davis' grandfather, James A. Garfield Davis, who was—in Davis' words—"a large, cantankerous man." The name Jon Arbuckle came from a 1950s coffee commercial. Jon's roommate Lyman, added to give Jon someone to talk with, carried on the name of an earlier Gnorm Gnat character.[6] The final character was Lyman's dog Spot, who was later renamed Odie. From 1976 to early 1978, these characters appeared in a strip called Jon which also ran in the Times. The early prototype strips were not generally well documented and were considered to be lost media until 2019 where a YouTube channel by the name of Quinton Reviews was able to retrieve several digital scans of the Jon publications from the Pendleton Community Library after gathering information via an obscure blogpost source within a lost media Wiki site. This strip first appeared in the Pendleton Times on January 8, 1976, just two weeks after Gnorm Gnat ended.

                        Garfield is an overweight, lazy and free-spirited orange cat who lives with his owner Jon Arbuckle. Garfield passes his time by antagonizing Jon and teasing his aggressive neighbor, Luca, a Doberman. Aside from Jon, Garfield maintains an unlikely friendship with a helpful mouse, Louis. Garfield also socializes with his fellow neighborhood cats, including Garfield's stooge Nermal and Arlene.

                        Meanwhile, a local television host, Happy Chapman, known for his cat "Persnikitty", is introduced as supposedly a happy man. In reality he is allergic to cats, jealous of his news reporter brother Walter J. Chapman, and wants to be more successful by performing on TV show Good Day New York. Jon has made a habit of bringing Garfield to the veterinarian, in order to see vet Dr. Liz Wilson (whom he is in love with). Jon tries to ask Liz out, but due to a misunderstanding, Jon is given custody of a dog named Odie, who is lovable, playful and friendly. Regardless, Jon and Liz begin dating. Garfield however, begins to dislikes Odie and tries to get rid of him by getting revenge. Odie is brought to a canine talent show, where Liz is a judge. Garfield gets involved in an altercation there with other dogs, which moves Odie to the center of the ring, where he begins dancing to "Hey Mama" by the Black Eyed Peas.
